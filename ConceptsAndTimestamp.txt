LinkedList
-linked list is linear data structure.
-linked list is made of nodes.
-nodes consist of data and address.
-one node has data as well as the the address of the next node.

USES
-it is a dynamic data structure.
-it can be shriked as well as grown at run time.
-it is memory efficient.
-After deletion and insertion no shifts are needed.

Disadvantages


itration 0
 temp = 1, cnt  = 0, 0<5 -> true then  temp = 2, cnt =1 

itration 1
temp = 2, cnt = 1,  1<5 ->true then temp = 3 ,cnt =2

iteration 2
temp = 3, cnt = 2,  2<5 -> true then temp = 4 ,cnt =3

iteration 3
temp = 4, cnt = 3, 3<5 ->true then temp = 5, cnt  = 4

iteration 4 
temp = 5 cnt = 4, 4<5 ->true then temp = 6, cnt = 5

iteration 5 
temp = 6, cnt 5, 5<5 -> flase we come out of loop
